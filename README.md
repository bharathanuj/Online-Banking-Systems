## Online banking system

###ABSTRACT:
  This project is aimed at developing an Online Banking for customers. The system is an online application that can be accessed with the proper login details.
  
The project has been planned to have  centralised storage of the database. Using the constructs of MySQL and all the user interfaces have been designed using HTML AND CSS. Database connectivity is planned using the “Database” methodology. The standards of security and data protection have been given a big choice for proper usage. The application takes care of different modules and their associated reports, which are produced as per the applicable strategies and standards that are put forward by the administrative staff.
The entire project has been developed keeping in view the distributed client server computing technology, in mind. The specification has been normalised up to 3NF to eliminate all the anomalies that may arise due to the database transactions that are executed by the general users and the organisational administration. The user interfaces are browser-specific to give distributed accessibility for the overall system. The internal database has been selected as MySQL.The basic constructs of table spaces, clusters and indexes have been exploited to provide higher consistency and reliability for data storage.MySQL was a choice as it provides the constructs of high-level reliability and security. The total front end was dominated using HTML 5,CSS. At all proper levels, high care was taken to check that the system manages the data consistency with proper business rules or validations. The database connectivity was planned using the latest “ Database connection” technology provided by Oracle. The authentication and authorization was cross checked at all the relevant stages.
