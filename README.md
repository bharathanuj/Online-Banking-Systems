## Online banking system
## ABSTRACT:
 This project is aimed at developing an Online Banking for customers.Online Banking is one of the most important financial activities which will be carried out by any person who holds a bank account.
 
 The system is an online application that can be accessed with the proper login details.The main objective of our project is to provide more security while performing online transactions by providing efficient authentication etc. In the existing system, we can perform all the operations using a single user id and password
 
Once a user logs in he or she can check the bank balance, check bank account transaction history or account summary, add beneficiary accounts, transfer funds to another account, download account summary. The customer using the online banking service would be given a user id along with two other passwords. One called Login Password and the other called transaction password. By using login password the customer can login to their account and we can perform only some (limited) operations like viewing A/C balance and personal details etc. But to perform a transfer or online transaction, the user needs to provide the transaction password and other secure information in order to complete the transaction successfully.

 The project has been planned to have  centralised storage of the database. Using the constructs of MySQL and all the user interfaces have been designed using HTML AND CSS. Database connectivity is planned using the “Database” methodology. The standards of security and data protection have been given a big choice for proper usage. The application takes care of different modules and their associated reports, which are produced as per the applicable strategies and standards that are put forward by the administrative staff.
 
The entire project has been developed keeping in view the distributed client server computing technology, in mind. The specification has been normalised up to 3NF to eliminate all the anomalies that may arise due to the database transactions that are executed by the general users and the organisational administration. The user interfaces are browser-specific to give distributed accessibility for the overall system. The internal database has been selected as MySQL.The basic constructs of table spaces, clusters and indexes have been exploited to provide higher consistency and reliability for data storage.MySQL was a choice as it provides the constructs of high-level reliability and security. The total front end was dominated using HTML 5,CSS. There are various activities that can be carried out once you log in to your bank account. Authentication and authorization was cross checked at all the relevant stages.
